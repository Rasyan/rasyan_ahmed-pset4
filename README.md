This is an app where you can make an list of things that you still need to do. A Todo list.
this todo list reads the data from a database and then displaces it in the list.

# Main Activity
this app only has one activity, this activity contains a title, a subtitle, an recyclerview and an Edit text with a submit button.

The recyclerview is the main attraction of the app, it shows a list of all the things you still need to todo.
At the start it will come with 4 entrys in the list that function as a short tutorial on how to use the app.

you can long press an entry to delete it from the list.
